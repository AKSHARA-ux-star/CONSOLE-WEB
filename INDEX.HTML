            <p>The Visual code studio is a text-based coding platform.It is a really adavanced and

                There is also a screen called console screen in any website you use , mostly chrome.
                To open it you have to right-click on your screen and press on inspect in the menu
                options it shows.Then it will open the console tab.The console screen is used to
                see the output of the html script.We can use the console.log() function to print
                the text in the console screen.

                var c=(a+b);
                console.log(c);
